[aexm] BRU (branch unconditional) does not properly forward its rD.
       For two cycles afterwards, the register that PC was written to
       (identified by rD) should not be read from, to ensure propagation
       of values.

[hyper] When issuing DMA transactions, the low 5 bits of the address are masked        out.

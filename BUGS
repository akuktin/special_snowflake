[aexm] BRU (branch unconditional) does not properly forward its rD.
       For two cycles afterwards, the register that PC was written to
       (identified by rD) should not be read from, to ensure propagation
       of values.

[aexm] Future bug when the virtual memory system gets implemented: branch that
       is the last or next-to last instruction on a memory page will bug out
       if one of the two delay instructions (regardless if they are masked out
       or active) triggers a page fault. Aexm will lose track of the correct
       PC and/or will lose an instruction.

[hyper] When issuing DMA transactions, the low 5 bits of the address are masked
        out.

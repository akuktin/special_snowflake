[aexm] Turn LOD into an uninterruptible instruction. That way, you can create
       a very simple userland-only mutex!

         addi   r2, r0, 0x0001;
         lodi   r1, r0, $mutex_address;
         bcci 0x10, r1, $wherever;  // r1 == 0 ?
         stri   r2, r0, $mutex_address;
         nop;

       Okay, so this particular mutex fails as a mutex, but you get the idea.
